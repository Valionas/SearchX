# Search Engine Client - React Application

## Overview

This project is a simple search engine client built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides a basic search interface with auto-completion, search history management, and result display functionalities. The project uses Context API for state management, Framer Motion for animations, and JSON Server as a mock backend for search data.

## Features

- **Search Input with Auto-completion**: As you type, suggestions are fetched and displayed based on the local data.
- **Search History Management**: Tracks and stores search history locally. Indicates if a query has been searched before.
- **Result Display**: Shows search results including a clickable title and description.
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth fade-in animations applied to the search input and container.
- **Context API**: Centralized state management for search-related data (query, suggestions, results, history).
- **JSON Server**: Serves as a mock backend to provide search data.
